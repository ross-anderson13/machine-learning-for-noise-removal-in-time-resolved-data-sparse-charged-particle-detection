This project involved building, training and using a modified autoencoder artificial neural network to denoise 1D signals originating from time-resolved ultrafast spectroscopy experiments

MATLAB used for simulation of experimental data and Python deep learning packages Keras and TensorFlow used as interface for neural network

Concluded that neural networks can provide a method of near-perfect denoising with time-saving benefits compounding with continued usage
